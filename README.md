# About: 
This is a weather dashboard that allows a user to search for a city and get current and future conditions for that city. That city is added to the search history. In addition to the city name the date, the user also sees an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. When viewing the UV index, the user is presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. When viewing future weather conditions for that city, the user is presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity. If a user clicks on a city in the search history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city. When the user opens the weather dashboard, they are presented with the last searched city forecast.
